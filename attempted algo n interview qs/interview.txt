HTML parsing, they really mean HTML deserialization - 
the process of taking a character stream and turning it into 
a object model, 

1. if linked list is empty then make the node as head and return it.

2. if the value of the node to be inserted is smaller than the value 
of the head node
then insert the node at the start and make it the head

3. in a loop, find the appropriate noded after which the input node
(let 9)
is to be inserted.
To find the appropriate node start from the head, 
keep moving until you reach a node GN (10 in the below diagram) who's 
value is greater than the input node. The node just before GN is the 
appropriate node (7)

4. insert the node (9) after the appropriate node (7) found in step 3.
